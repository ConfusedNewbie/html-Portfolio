<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I'm a computer enthusiast based in vadodara who enjoys the gratification that comes from solving
  problems along with the process that precedes it.

  I did my schooling till 10th grade in Kendriya Vidyalaya IFFCO and then moved on to complete my 11th
  and 12th grade in Sadhu Vaswani International School. Currently I am pursuing a degree in computer 
  science from Parul Institute of Engineering and Technology.

  In my free time I prefer reading fictions or just drawing whatever comes to my mind. I also like watching
  anime or just animated movies as I think they are able to tell stories unlike any other medium, watching them
  makes me able to expand my imagination and enhance my thought process.
